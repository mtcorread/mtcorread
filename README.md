# Hi, I'm Martha Correa-Delval

I am a Research Software Engineer at the Advanced Research Computing department at Durham University.  
My work focuses on developing, optimising, and supporting research software — from simulation frameworks to performance-critical scientific applications.

I have an interdisciplinary background that combines Artificial Intelligence, simulation, and human-computer interaction.  

- **Current work:** Developing and optimising large-scale agent-based models that simulate the spread of diseases through digital twins of populations.  
- **Previous research:**  
  - **PhD:** Artificial Intelligence for Smart Energy Systems, focusing on optimising energy consumption to reduce CO₂ emissions.  
  - **Postdoc:** Human-Computer Interaction, exploring how older adults perceive and engage with new technologies through UI/UX design.  
- I collaborate closely with researchers and academics to produce reproducible, efficient, and well-documented research software.  
- My projects often combine solo development with interdisciplinary teamwork.
